Oh, chunk.
==========
“Oh, chunk.” is a ‘challenge’ world that I've created for Mojang's [Minecraft][] video-game. If
you've played Noobcrew's [Skyblock Survival][skyblock], or SethBling's [SkyGrid][], then you're
familiar with the concept. However, there's one crucial difference: Skyblock and friends game
against the renewability system by restricting (extremely) the availability of *resources*, but
provide you infinite space to build in once you've understood and conquered the
resource-restrictions. By way of contrast, “Oh, chunk.” restricts *both resources and spaces*,
requiring you to function, survive, and advance within an extremely small square of blocks.

Whereas Skyblock and SkyGrid plays tend towards large, sprawling home-bases with all sorts of farms,
mob-spawners, and constructs spiraling off into the distance; Chunk is intended to require you to
painstakingly manage space *as well as* resources. For instance, in a Chunk play-through,
**sunlight** is effectively reduced to a precious resource.

More on these later, perhaps, but if you're planning to push up to this repository:

 - `level.dat` is ignored, intentionally; so any changes you make shouldn't be picked up ... but
   nonetheless, do your best to make sure your “player status” isn't carried over into your changes
   in any way, if you find yourself needing to launch the game and use Creative mode instead of
   MCEdit or similar.
