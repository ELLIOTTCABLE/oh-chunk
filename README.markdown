Oh, chunk.
==========
“Oh, chunk.” is a ‘challenge’ world that I've created for Mojang's [Minecraft][] video-game. If
you've played Noobcrew's [Skyblock Survival][skyblock], or SethBling's [SkyGrid][], then you're
familiar with the concept. However, there's one crucial difference: Skyblock and friends game
against the renewability system by restricting (extremely) the availability of *resources*, but
provide you infinite space to build in once you've understood and conquered the
resource-restrictions. By way of contrast, “Oh, chunk.” restricts *both resources and spaces*,
requiring you to function, survive, and advance within an extremely small square of blocks.

Whereas Skyblock and SkyGrid plays tend towards large, sprawling home-bases with all sorts of farms,
mob-spawners, and constructs spiraling off into the distance; Chunk is intended to require you to
painstakingly manage space *as well as* resources. For instance, in a Chunk play-through,
**sunlight** is effectively reduced to a precious resource.
