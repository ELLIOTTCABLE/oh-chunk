Oh, chunk.
==========
“Oh, chunk.” is a ‘challenge’ world that I've created for Mojang's [Minecraft][] video-game. If
you've played Noobcrew's [Skyblock Survival][skyblock], or SethBling's [SkyGrid][], then you're
familiar with the concept. However, there's one crucial difference: Skyblock and friends game
against the renewability system by restricting (extremely) the availability of *resources*, but
provide you infinite space to build in once you've understood and conquered the
resource-restrictions. By way of contrast, “Oh, chunk.” restricts *both resources and spaces*,
requiring you to function, survive, and advance within an extremely small square of blocks.

Whereas Skyblock and SkyGrid plays tend towards large, sprawling home-bases with all sorts of farms,
mob-spawners, and constructs spiraling off into the distance; Chunk is intended to require you to
painstakingly manage space *as well as* resources. For instance, in a Chunk play-through,
**sunlight** is effectively reduced to a precious resource.

Playing
-------
Currently, I'm not intending to set specific ‘challenges’ for Chunk players, à la Skyblock's. More
than anything else, the primary goal of “Oh, chunk.” is to *escape* the Chunk into the Overworld.

There's only a few rules:

1. The first rule of Fight Club ... is to not spoil it for anyone else. **Please, *please* preface any
   commentary you publish that might let other players in on the secrets of the map with some sort
   of spoiler-warning!** This applies even if you're intentionally discussing solutions to the
   problems Chunk presents, or doing Let's Play-style coverage. (I've seen Skyblock ruined for
   altogether too many newcomers, by the viral nature of [CaptainSparklez][].)
   
   But seriously, **warn them to play it themselves, first!**

2. No cheats or commands. (What's the point of a challenge-map, if you're not going to rise to the
   challenge, eh? Where's the fun in that?)
3. In a similar vein, no mods. Particularly, no SmartMoving, or anything that allows you to fit
   through 1×1 spaces; but nothing else is considered kosher, either. Play Chunk completely vanilla.

----

Those said, there's a few more notes I'd like to leave for the aspiring Chunker:

 - There *is* a way out;
 - That way out is not *geographically* hidden. You don't need to mine every single block you ever
   manage to work out a way to access, to find some sneakily-hidden hole over in the corner of the
   map. That's not fun, nor does it require much thought!
 - The map is designed to be played on [Hardcore][] mode. Yes, that's scary, for those of you who've
   always shied away from that big bad Hardcore button; but give it a chance. As challenge-maps go,
   Chunk isn't a very long drawn-out one. If you *do* screw it up and die, it's much easier to start
   over than it is in Skyblock or SkyGrid and friends. Don't be afraid!

> (That said, it's acceptable Chunking practice for the newcomer to occasionally *manually* copy their
>  savefolder, and restore it after dying. This retains the desired hunger-mechanics and at least
>  *some* death-penalty, without the over-extreme pain of starting over entirely from scratch.
>  I call this “Hardishcore Mode.”

>  Also, it's reasonable to [disable Hardcore after you escape][disable-hardcore], if you wish to
>  continue playing your world, but aren't the type to enjoy that sort of pressure.)

About
-----
Most of the most popular or interesting things I see in Minecraft are so *large*. I wanted to
encourage compactness, and the development/furthering of various techniques for *compact* designs in
this game. More compact farms, more compact spawners, more compact circuits, and more compact
constructs of all sorts. Hence, this approach to restriction-challenges.

I'd *eventually* like this to be a map *generator*. Manually re-arranging things manually in MCEdit
has been time-consuming, and burns me out quickly. Unfortunately, I fucking hate Java. Perhaps I can
get one of you fine chaps to do it for me? ;)

As for the name ... I started playing Minecraft with my girlfriend. The night we began playing, we
were quickly overridden by zombies, lost the (very little, in retrospect) that we'd managed to do,
and got very fed-up very quickly. For weeks thereafter, we both exclusively played in Peaceful.
Finally, when I decided to balls-up and try to take on Easy, and mobs, again, I titled the world
we'd be playing in “Oh, fuck.” This map is intended to evoke a similar feeling. (That, and the
entire game, or at least the first parts of it, are played in a single Minecraft [‘chunk.’][chunk])

If you come across any bugs or perceive any imbalances in the world, they can be reported on the
GitHub issue-tracker. The same goes for any ‘feature’ requests:

### [Issues →](https://github.com/ELLIOTTCABLE/oh-chunk/issues)

**Note:** These are likely to include spoilers! If you want a ‘pure’ Chunking experience, stay away
from the issue tracker until you've escaped, yourself!

More on these later, perhaps, but if you're planning to push up to this repository:

 - `level.dat` is ignored, intentionally; so any changes you make shouldn't be picked up ... but
   nonetheless, do your best to make sure your “player status” isn't carried over into your changes
   in any way, if you find yourself needing to launch the game and use Creative mode instead of
   MCEdit or similar.
