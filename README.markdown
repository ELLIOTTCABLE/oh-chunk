Oh, chunk.
==========
“Oh, chunk.” is a ‘challenge’ world that I've created for Mojang's [Minecraft][] video-game. If
you've played Noobcrew's [Skyblock Survival][skyblock], or SethBling's [SkyGrid][], then you're
familiar with the concept. However, there's one crucial difference: Skyblock and friends game
against the renewability system by restricting (extremely) the availability of *resources*, but
provide you infinite space to build in once you've understood and conquered the
resource-restrictions. By way of contrast, “Oh, chunk.” restricts *both resources and space*,
requiring you to function, survive, and advance within an extremely small square of blocks.

Whereas Skyblock and SkyGrid plays tend towards large, sprawling home-bases with all sorts of farms,
mob-spawners, and constructs spiraling off into the distance; Chunk is intended to require you to
painstakingly manage space as well as resources. For instance, in a Chunk play-through, sunlight
itself is effectively reduced to a precious resource!

Installing
----------
### [Download the latest release →](http://www.curse.com/worlds/minecraft/oh-chunk/download)
Unzip it into your [Minecraft `saves/` folder][saves]. That's it.

I also push releases here to GitHub first, although I prefer if you download them from Curse (it
helps my download stats, which would be nice for getting this world some exposure. ;) You can view
all of the releases and their release notes [here][releases].

Playing
-------
Your primary goal in “Oh, chunk.” is to *escape* the Chunk into the full Overworld. Specifically,
you must reach the victory-monument at **(50, -70)**.

There's only a few rules:

1. The first rule of Fight Club ... is to not spoil it for anyone else. **Please, *please* preface any
   commentary you publish that might let other players in on the secrets of the map with some sort
   of spoiler-warning!** This applies even if you're intentionally discussing solutions to the
   problems Chunk presents, or doing Let's Play-style coverage. (I've seen Skyblock ruined for
   altogether too many newcomers, by the viral nature of [CaptainSparklez][].)
   
   But seriously, **warn them to play it themselves, first!**

2. No cheats or commands. (What's the point of a challenge-map, if you're not going to rise to the
   challenge, eh? Where's the fun in that?)
3. In a similar vein, no mods. Particularly, no SmartMoving, or anything that allows you to fit
   through 1×1 spaces; but nothing else is considered kosher, either. Play Chunk completely vanilla.

4. The map is designed to be played on [Hardcore][] mode. Yes, that's scary, for those of you who've
   always shied away from that big bad Hardcore button; but give it a chance. As challenge-maps go,
   Chunk isn't a very long drawn-out one. If you *do* screw it up and die, it's much easier to start
   over than it is in Skyblock or SkyGrid and friends. Don't be afraid!

> (That said, it's acceptable Chunking practice for the newcomer to occasionally *manually* copy their
>  savefolder, and restore it after dying. This retains the desired hunger-mechanics and at least
>  *some* death-penalty, without the over-extreme pain of starting over entirely from scratch.
>  I call this “Hardishcore Mode.”
>  
>  Also, it's reasonable to [disable Hardcore after you escape][disable-hardcore], if you wish to
>  continue playing your world, but aren't the type to enjoy that sort of pressure.)

### Challenges
If escape isn't difficult enough to keep you occupied, then you may wish to complete the following
individual challenges:

 - Make your Chunk a little more homey.
   
   > (Build something qualifying as “a home.” Populate it with torches, a chair made out of stairs
   >  and signs, a bed, a kitchen with a stove made [a furnace and trapdoor], and a potted flower.)
   
 - Bring home a puppy, to pass those lonely nights in the Chunk. Give him a pretty collar.
   
   > (Bring home a wolf, tame it, and dye its collar.)
   
 - Partake in that ‘backyard fruit and vegetable garden’ craze.
   
   > (Grow potatos, carrots, pumpkins, white mushrooms, and melons simultaneously within three
   >  blocks of the outside walls of your house.)
   
 - Map out the Chunk.
   
   > (Create a map and hang it in your house, using exclusively materials you gathered and crafted.)
   
 - Pig out.
   
   > (Fill your hunger-bar from zero to ten, by eating an entire cake and an entire pumpkin-pie in
   >  one sitting. Both must be crafted by you, from materials you gathered by hand.)
   
 - Relax by your favourite fishing-hole.
   
   > (Build a small lake, at least 99 [~5×7×3] blocks of still-water in size, and fish out of it.)
   
 - Put up with that revolting, repetitive, squishy sound coming from your neighbours' bedroom.
   
   > (Arrange for slimes to spawn repeatedly continuously to your house.)
   
 - Prepare for the inevitable zombie apocalypse: move your home underground.
   
   > (Replace all the doors and windows of your house with steel doors w/ buttons and iron bars.
   >  Construct a cavern-roof at least four blocks *above* the top of your house, consisting of at
   >  least one layer of smooth-stone, and at least one layer of grass-dirt. This roof must span the
   >  entire Chunk, short only enough room for stairs or a ladder.)
   
 - Explore “jungle-chic.”
   
   > (Cover the walls of the entire Chunk with vines.)
   
 - Become a punk-rocker.
   
   > (Acquire a full set of chainmail armor.)
   
 - Get bored with that, and become a model-train conductor.
   
   > (Build a circular minecart track, with a powered rail, in a ‘basement’ room under the rest of
   >  your house. Ride it around the track.)
   
 - Get bored with that. Become a bartender.
   
   > (Brew at least one of every possible potion.)
   
 - Get bored with that. Become a potent wizard instead, by making yourself a powerful wand.
   
   > (Enchant a single wooden axe with as manu max-leveled enchantments as are possible:
   >  Sharpness V, Efficiency V, Fortune III, and Unbreaking III. Name it.)

 - Outshine the stars.
   
   > (Build a beacon in the center of the Chunk. Ensure its beam can reach the sky.)
   
 - Celebrate your success.
   
   > (Craft at least one firework using each possible firework-component. Fire them off together.)
   > (Including: at least one rocket each with diamond, glowstone dust, fire-charge, gold nugget,
   >  feather, and mob-head.)

### Notes
Those said, there's a few more notes I'd like to leave for the aspiring Chunker:

 - There *is* a way out;
 - ... that way out is not *geographically* hidden. You don't need to mine every single block you ever
   manage to work out a way to access, to find some sneakily-hidden hole over in the corner of the
   map. That's not fun, nor does it require much thought!
 - ... nor are you able to directly climb out. Don't waste half an hour of your play-time trying.
   
 - This is definitely a map that's fun to play with friends; but be aware that that'll stretch the
   already-scarce resources out even more. It'll likely be difficult to avoid starving at the start
   with more than a couple players.

About
-----
Most of the most popular or interesting things I see in Minecraft are so *large*. I wanted to
encourage compactness, and the development/furthering of various techniques for *compact* designs in
this game. More compact farms, more compact spawners, more compact circuits, and more compact
constructs of all sorts. Hence, this approach to restriction-challenges.

I'd *eventually* like this to be a map *generator*. Manually re-arranging things manually in MCEdit
has been time-consuming, and burns me out quickly. Unfortunately, I fucking hate Java. Perhaps I can
get one of you fine chaps to do it for me? ;)

As for the name ... I started playing Minecraft with my girlfriend. The night we began playing, we
were quickly overridden by zombies, lost all (very little, in retrospect) that we'd managed to do,
and got very fed-up very quickly. For weeks thereafter, we both exclusively played in Peaceful.
Finally, when I decided to balls-up and try to take on Easy, and mobs, again, I titled the world
we'd be playing in “Oh, fuck.” This map is intended to evoke a similar feeling. (That, and the
entire game, or at least the first parts of it, are played in a single Minecraft [‘chunk.’][chunk])

stay away from the issue tracker. At least, until *you've* escaped. ;)
